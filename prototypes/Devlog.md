Some things that I learned this week:

* `cubic_bezier` returns funky numbers when the sample number `n` is too high, and the cubic bezier points are too tight. This will require tuning.
* [Compression-oriented programming](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015). It's the idea of unlearning the object-oriented mindset, and writing procedural code that you can then "compress" by pulling code into functions. It's also a neat reminder that all programs are just data, and functions that operate (that is, read or write) upon that data.
